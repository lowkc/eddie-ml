# Trimers repository
Here you'll find the data and code needed to reproduce the results from our paper predicting the three-body non-additive interaction energy and total energy for trimer systems. ```generate_cubes.py``` uses PySCF to generate electron deformation density .cube files. The ```get_dens_coeffs.py``` script gets descriptor coefficients from the electron density. In the paper we used```method='power_spectrum'``` to ensure rotation invariance of the coefficients, but other methods are available within the code.
